• master — Stores original and authoritative zone records for a namespace, and answers
queries about the namespace from other nameservers.

• slave — Answers queries from other nameservers concerning namespaces for which it is
considered an authority. However, slave nameservers get their namespace information from
master nameservers.

• caching-only — Offers name to IP resolution services but is not authoritative for any zones.
Answers for all resolutions are cached in memory for a fixed period of time, which is specified
by the retrieved zone record.

• forwarding — Forwards requests to a specific list of nameservers for name resolution. If
none of the specified nameservers can perform the resolution, the resolution fails.

3.1. Zone File Directives


$INCLUDE — Configures named to include another zone file in this zone file at the place where
the directive appears. This allows additional zone settings to be stored apart from the main
zone file.

• $ORIGIN — Appends the domain name to unqualified records, such as those with the hostname
and nothing more
