/nfs1           192.168.1.0/24(rw,wdelay,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,anonuid=65534,anongid=65534) 


exports -a          mount nfs all 

Examples

    To export all directories in the /etc/exports file, enter:

    exportfs -a 

    To export one directory from the /etc/exports file, enter:

    exportfs /home/notes

    In this example, the /home/notes directory is exported.
    Note:
    For this command to work, the /home/notes directory must be specified in the /etc/exports file.
    To unexport a directory, enter:

    exportfs -u /home/notes

    In this example, the /home/notes directory is unexported.
    To display the name of the directory currently being exported, enter:

    exportfs -v

    To export a directory that is not specified in the /etc/exports file, enter:

    exportfs -i /home/zeus

    In this example, the /home/zeus directory is exported without restrictions.
    To export a directory and give netgroup members permission to access this directory, enter:

    exportfs access=cowboys:oilers /home/notes -o 

    In this example, the /home/notes directory is exported and permits users of cowboys and oilers host machines to have access.
    To export a directory with different options from the /etc/exports file, enter:

    exportfs -i -o root=zorro:silver /directory

    In this example, the /directory directory is exported and allows root user access to zorro and silver host machines, regardless of the access permissions specified in the /etc/exports file.
    To export the /common/docs directory with write permissions to clients using Kerberos authentication, but read-only permissions to clients using UNIX authentication, add the following text to the /etc/exports file:

    /common/docs -sec=krb5,rw,sec=sys,ro

    Then enter exportfs /common/docs to perform the export.
    To create a referral at /usr/info to the /usr/info directory on host infoserver, add the following line to /etc/exports and then export /usr/info:

    /usr/info -vers=4,refer=/usr/info@infoserver

    To specify replicas for the /common/info directory at hosts backup1 and backup2, add the following line to /etc/exports and then export /common/info:

    /common/info -vers=4,replicas=/common/info@backup1:/common/info@backup2,<other options>

    To export the /common/docs directory with both version 3 and version 4, enter the following command:

    exportfs -V 3:4 /common/docs

    To export all of the version 4 entries in the /etc/exports file, enter the following command:

    exportfs -a -V 4

    To unexport the /common/docs directory only for version 3, enter the following command:

    exportfs -u -V 3 /common/docs

    To unexport all of the version 3 entries in the /etc/xtab file, enter the following command:

    exportfs -ua -V 3

    To specify referrals for the /common/docs directory at hosts named s1, s2 and s3 and scatter them fully, add the following line to the /etc/exports file and then export the /common/docs directory:

    /common/docs -vers=4,refer=/common/docs@s1:/common/docs@s2:/common/docs@s3,scatter=full

    To specify replicas for the /common/docs directory at hosts named s1, s2, s3 and s4 and scatter them partially (the first fail over server is s1 for all combinations), add the following line to the /etc/exports file and then export the /common/docs directory:

    /common/docs -vers=4,noauto,replicas=/common/docs@s1:/common/docs@s2:/common/docs@s3:/common/docs@s4,

    scatter=partial
