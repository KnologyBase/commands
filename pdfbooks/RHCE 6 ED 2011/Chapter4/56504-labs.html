<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><B>LABS</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">During
the Red Hat exams, the tasks will be presented electronically.
Therefore, this book presents most of the labs electronically as
well. For more information, see the Lab Questions section toward the
end of Chapter 4.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Red Hat exams are unique based on their reliance on labs and hands-on
demonstrations. Be aware, while Labs 1 and 2 cover different topics,
they are designed to be run consecutively. The same is true for Labs
5, 6, and 7, which are also designed to be run consecutively.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><B>Lab
1</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
this lab you'll explore the role of permissions and the SUID bit. To
do so, you'll create a simple script in the /usr/local/bin directory.
Call it script1.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1.
In a text editor, open file script1 in the /usr/local/bin directory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2.
Enter the following lines in that file:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; border: none; padding: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Courier"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">#!/bin/bash<BR>/bin/ls
&gt; filelist</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3.
Save the file.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4.
Try to execute that script as the root administrative user. What
happens?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5.
Set up execute permissions for the user owner of the script1 file
with the <B>chmod</B> <B>u+x /usr/local/bin/script1</B> command. Can
you now execute the script as the root administrative user?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6.
Now set up execute permissions for other users in the script1 file.
Log in as a regular user. Can you now execute the script as a regular
user?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">7.
As it's a big security risk to set SUID permissions on a shell
script, don't do that on the script1 file. Instead, remove SUID
permissions on the /usr/bin/passwd executable file with the <B>chmod</B>
<B>u-s /usr/bin/passwd</B> command.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">8.
Try to run the <B>passwd</B> command as a regular user. What happens?
Did your password change? Try again. What worked when prompted for
the current password?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">9.
Return to the root user account, and restore SUID permissions on the
/usr/bin/passwd file.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">10.
Try to run the <B>passwd</B> command again as a regular user. Change
your password. What happens this time?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><B>Lab
2</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
this lab, you'll use the script created in Lab 1. You'll set up
regular permissions on that script, and then configure ACLs for that
script to be executed by a regular user. It also assumes that the
filesystem with the /usr/local/bin directory is the top-level root
directory, and is not already mounted with ACLs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1.
Change the permissions on the script1 file created in Lab 1 with the
<B>chmod</B> <B>644 /usr/local/bin/script1</B> command.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2.
Log in as a regular user. Try to execute that script. What happens?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3.
Remount the top-level root directory (/) with ACLs with the following
command:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; border: none; padding: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Courier"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"># mount -o
remount,acl /</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As
long as the /etc/fstab file is configured in the top-level root
directory (/), this command should work. To verify, run the <B>mount</B>
command by itself; it should show output similar to:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; border: none; padding: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Courier"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">/dev/vda2
on / type ext4 (rw,acl)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4.
Now you'll be able to set ACLs on the noted script. Configure read
and execute ACLs for one regular user on the script1 file. Verify
with the <B>getfacl</B> command.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">5.
Repeat Step 2, logging in as the regular user given ACL privileges to
the script1 script. What happens?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">6.
If you want to restore the original configuration, delete the script1
file from the /usr/local/bin directory. If your original
configuration did not include ACLs on the top level root directory,
you can restore that situation with the following command:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; border: none; padding: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Courier"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"># mount -o
remount /</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><B>Lab
3</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
this lab, you'll set ACLs for a regular user for the root
administrative user's home directory, /root. Start with setting ACLs
for the directory, and review the results from the regular user's
account. What files can be read from the /root directory? What else
do you have to do to set up ACLs on a specific file in the /root
directory?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Just
make sure to disable ACLs on the /root directory when the lab is
complete. ACLs can be a risky business if the account of the subject
regular user is ever compromised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><B>Lab
4</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
this lab, you'll review the process for disabling and re-enabling
SELinux on a system. Review the current status of SELinux with the
<B>sestatus</B> command. You can disable SELinux through the
/etc/sysconfig/selinux file, or through the SELinux Administration
tool. Do so and reboot the system. Try the <B>sestatus</B> command
again. Re-enable SELinux and reboot the system. What happens? Does
the process take long? How many times does the system reboot? What
would happen if you had to wait for the relabel and the reboot
process during a Red Hat exam?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><B>Lab
5</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
this lab, you'll set up one regular user in the SELinux guest_u
category. Remember that the relevant commands start with <B>semanage</B>
<B>login</B>. Given the options with the __default__ user, there are
multiple ways to meet the requirements of this lab.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Before
making any changes, record the current status of SELinux users; one
method is with the following command, which records the output in the
selinuxusers file. (Strangely enough, a single forward redirection
arrow does not record the output from the noted command.)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; border: none; padding: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Courier"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"># semanage
login -l &gt;&gt; selinuxusers</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Your
work will continue in Lab 6.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><B>Lab
6</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Now
with the regular user in the guest_u category, see what you can do.
Try the following actions:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1.
Try logging into the GUI. What happens?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2.
Log into a regular console. Try running the <B>startx</B> command.
What kind of user message do you get?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">3.
Back in the console, try the <B>su</B> and <B>sudo</B> commands. What
happens?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">4.
Try some of the system-config-* commands. What happens?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><B>Lab
7</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
this lab, you'll activate the allow_guest_exec_content SELinux
boolean. Do so with a command that ensures that the change survives a
reboot. Once complete, log out as the configured guest user, and log
back in. Create a script; one simple script is shown here:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; border: none; padding: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Courier"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">#!/bin/bash<BR>/bin/df
&gt; disks</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Make
sure to make the script executable. If the script runs and the disks
file is created, then you were successful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When
the process is complete, log in to the GUI as an unconfined user and
review the SELinux users in the GUI SELinux Administration tool. (For
this purpose, it's acceptable to log into the GUI with the root
administrative account.) Use the User Mapping section, and the tools
available to restore the original configuration as documented in the
selinuxusers file. Don't forget to deactivate the
allow_guest_exec_content boolean.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Lab
8</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In
this lab, you'll create a new /ftp directory with SELinux contexts
appropriate for that directory. It should be based on the contexts in
the /var/ftp/pub directory. Use the knowledge that you gained in this
chapter to complete this lab. When you are done, restore the original
contexts on the /ftp directory. How do the SELinux contexts differ?
From what file did the restored contexts come from? Are the restored
contexts the same as when the /ftp directory was created?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><B>Lab
9</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">At
this point, you should have some data available in an audit.log file
in the /var/log/audit directory. If so, try to read the log file. If
not, make sure SELinux is set in enforcing (or at least in
permissive) mode. Make sure the audit service is working with the
/etc/init.d/auditd restart command.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Apply
the <B>sealert</B> <B>-a</B> command to that file; you may want to
redirect that output to a text file for easier perusal. Can you
identify problems in the file? What users have been identified in
that file? Can you identify problem users and groups by their UID and
GID numbers? For more information on UIDs and GIDs, see Chapter 8.
Are there any proposed solutions?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If
you don't have a current audit.log file or just need another
perspective, a sample audit.log file has been included on the
Chapter4/ directory of the CD. That directory also includes the
sealert.audit.output file, which is what happens to the file after
the <B>sealert</B> <B>-a</B> command has been applied to it.</P>
