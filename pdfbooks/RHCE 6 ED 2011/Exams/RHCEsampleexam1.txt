RHCE Sample Exam 1

Start with the preconfigured RHEL 6 system described in Appendix A. Make sure that system is currently powered down. As discussed in Appendix A, a current repository of the installation DVD is available from an FTP server configured on the local system. SELinux should be set to enforcing mode. You'll have two hours to complete the following tasks:

1. Configure an SSH server with access limited to the local network. Create local users named katie and dickens. Limit SSH access on that server only to user katie.

2. Configure a Samba server. Share a directory named /food with user dickens. Share a second directory named /book limited to users tim and stephanie.

3. Set up a vsFTP server with access limited to the server1.example.com and the physical host system.

4. Set up a local NTP server, accessible to the local network.

5. Configure an NFS server to share the /home directory only with the physical host system.

6. Configure Apache with two secure web sites on the same virtual server. Call those web sites shost1.example.com and shost2.example.com. Create and configure an appropriate SSL key for those web sites.

7. Configure a local caching nameserver, and set up the local system to use that nameserver.

8. Create a script that backs up all files from the /home directory on a daily basis.

9. Create an RPM from a single file. Use the README file in the /usr/share/doc/tcp_wrappers-7.6 directory. Set up the RPM with a package name of tcpwrapdoc, version 1.0. When installed, it should write the README file to the /opt/tcpwrap directory.

10. Configure IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding on the local system.

11. Set up system activity reports to run the related accounting tool every five minutes.
