The mpstat command is used to report the activities of each of the available CPUs on a
multiprocessor server. Global average activities among all CPUs are also reported. The
mpstat utility is part of the sysstat package.


mpstat -P ALL


mpstat 3 3

iostat 

Performance problems can be encountered when too many files are opened, read and written
to, then closed repeatedly. This could become apparent as seek times (the time it takes to
move to the exact track where the data is stored) start to increase. Using the iostat tool, you
can monitor the I/O device loading in real time. Different options enable you to drill down even deeper to gather the necessary data.


vmstat provides information about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps, and CPU
activity. The vmstat command displays either average data or actual samples. The sampling
mode is enabled by providing vmstat with a sampling frequency and a sampling duration.



sar

The sar command is used to collect, report, and save system activity information. The sar
command consists of three applications: sar, which displays the data, and sa1 and sa2, which
are used for collecting and storing the data. The sar tool features a wide range of options so
be sure to check the man page for it. The sar utility is part of the sysstat package.
