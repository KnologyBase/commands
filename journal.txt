The ext3 and ReiserFS file systems introduced journaling capabilities to Linux systems.
Journaling provides for fast and effective recovery in case of disk crashes, instead of using
e2fsck or fsck. With journaling, a log is kept of all file system actions, which are placed in
a journal file. In the event of a crash, Linux only needs to read the journal file and replay it
 to restore the system to its previous (stable) state. Files that were in the process of writing
 to the disk can be restored to their original state. Journaling also avoids lengthy fsck checks 
on reboots that occur when your system suddenly loses power or freezes and has to be restarted 
physically. Instead of using fsck to manually check each file and directory, your
system just reads its journal files to restore the file system.
